## Who We Are

QL Security (Quantum Leap Security Limited) is a forward-thinking cybersecurity consultancy specializing in AI security gap analysis and GRC-aligned services. We help organizations identify vulnerabilities in their AI systems, ensure regulatory compliance, and build resilient security frameworks designed for emerging threats.

Founded by security professionals with deep expertise in governance, risk, and compliance, we understand that today's security landscape demands more than traditional approaches. As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly embedded in business operations, organizations face novel security challenges that require specialized knowledge and proactive strategies.
